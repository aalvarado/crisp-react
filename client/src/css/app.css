  This file is a placeholder for CSS imports. It can be
  referenced in .tsx files under src/ using import:
    import <some path starting with ../>/css/app.css

  For example, if react-day-picker or other component
  that comes with its own custom CSS was used, then this
  file would have:
    @import "react-day-picker/lib/style.css";
