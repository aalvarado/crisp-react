/*
  This file is a placeholder for CSS @imports. The
  imports can be referenced in .tsx files under src/
  using import:
    import <some path>/css/app.css

  For example, if react-day-picker (or other component
  that comes with its own custom CSS) was used, then
  this file would have:
    @import "react-day-picker/lib/style.css";
